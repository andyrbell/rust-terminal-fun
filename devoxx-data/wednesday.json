Join this critical review of the major decisions taken in a typical enterprise application architecture and learn to balance pragmatism with your design goals. Find out how to do just-in-time design to keep as many use-cases as simple as possible. The core purpose of this presentation is to learn to strike a **balance between pragmatism and maintainability** in your design. Without continuous refactoring, a simple design will inevitably degenerate into a Big Ball of Mud, under the assault of the new features and bugfixes. On the other hand, the very highly-factored code can burden the take-off of the development and end up freezing the mindset in some rigid upfront design. The end goal of this talk is to challenge you to rethink critically the architecture of your systems and seek ways to simplify it to match your actual needs, with a pragmatic mindset. \"Architecture is the art of postponing decisions\", said Uncle Bob. This talk takes this idea further and explains an optimal mindset about designing enterprise applications: Evolving (Continuously Refactoring) a Pragmatic (Simple), Clean (aka Onion) Architecture, aiming to provide Developer Safety™️ and Comfort™️. It’s the philosophy that Victor distilled over the past 5 years, designing and implementing 9 applications as IBM Lead Architect, and delivering training and advises to many other companies. You’ll learn how to break data into pieces (Fit Entities, Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects), how to keep the logic simple (Facades, Domain Services, logic extraction patterns, Mappers, AOP), layering to enforce boundaries (keeping DTOs out of your logic, Dependency Inversion Principle), and many more, all in a dynamic, interactive and extremely entertaining session.","talkTitle":"Evolving a Pragmatic, Clean Architecture - A Craftsman's Guide","talkId":49106},{"id":110653,"fromDate":"2019-11-06T11:00:00Z","toDate":"2019-11-06T11:50:00Z","overflow":false,"reserved":false,"remark":null,"roomId":1207,"roomName":"Room 6","sessionTypeId":1251,"sessionTypeName":"Conference","sessionTypeDuration":50,"sessionTypeBreak":false,"audienceLevel":"BEGINNER","langName":null,"timezone":"Europe/Brussels","trackId":"1154","trackName":"Java Language","trackImageURL":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/voxxeddays/webapp/images/f63a6ff7-0b15-4feb-b0fb-06aad848e601.png","speakers":[{"id":50812,"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Wuerthinger","company":"Oracle Labs"},{"id":52018,"firstName":"Vojin","lastName":"Jovanovic","company":"Oracle Labs"},{"id":49072,"firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Šelajev","company":"Oracle"}],"tags":[{"name":"GraalVM"},{"name":"performance"},{"name":"JVM"}],"talkDescription":"Performance-aware code often sacrifices elegance and readability for being fast. Previously, to get the best performance developers often had to manually tweak the code to follow certain patterns known to run faster. Nowadays we have better compilers which often don't require such efforts and allow one to write readable code without sacrificing performance.\nIn this session, we discuss how to write Java code without worrying about performance regressions very much. We'll look at the typical code patterns used for writing high-performance Java, refactor them into an easier maintainable, better-looking code without losing performance.

For the Flemish Government, this means that humans still need to read doctor's handwritings and enter the text in databases through custom-made data-entry form applications. This is a time-consuming process, especially for medical data, which needs to be treated with great accuracy. Also, a fraction of about 10% of handwritings cannot be read with sufficient accuracy by a human, and requires double-checking.\n\nWe developed a data-processing pipeline for one such use case with the goal of supporting the humans by reading the handwritings and predicting what is written. Together with the predicted text, we calculate confidences for the predictions and we show that we can define confidence levels above which the machine predictions perform better than a human. We also show that the machine can suggest predictions for illegible handwritings, which allows the human to decreases the number of illegible handwritings by about 30%.\n\nIn this presentation, we will present the end-to-end pipeline, from data mining and anonymisation, through data cleaning with numerous image-processing steps, to building and applying the deep-learning model, augmented with some natural language processing. We will show real-life examples and present ample statics to show the validity of the model.\n\nThis type of AI modelling of doctor's handwriting can be applied to numerous related use cases.","talkTitle":"Deciphering doctor's handwriting with deep learning","talkId":25153},{"id":26884,"fromDate":"2019-11-06T11:00:00Z","toDate":"2019-11-06T11:50:00Z","overflow":false,"reserved":false,"remark":null,"roomId":1201,"roomName":"Room 8","sessionTypeId":1251,"sessionTypeName":"Conference","sessionTypeDuration":50,"sessionTypeBreak":false,"audienceLevel":"BEGINNER","langName":null,"timezone":"Europe/Brussels","trackId":"1159","trackName":"Cloud, Containers & Infrastructure","trackImageURL":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/voxxeddays/webapp/images/227114b5-6c72-4059-82ef-be9bf00ddd47.png","speakers":[{"id":50574,"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Stanley","company":"IBM UK"}],"tags":[{"name":"Apache Kafka"},{"name":"Kubernetes"},{"name":"Event-Driven Microservices"}],"talkDescription":"The rise of Apache Kafka as the de-facto standard for event streaming has coincided with the rise of Kubernetes for cloud-native applications. While Kubernetes is a great choice for any distributed system, that doesn't mean it is easy to deploy and maintain a Kafka cluster running on it. At IBM we have hands-on experience with running Kafka in Kubernetes and in this session I will share our top tips for a smooth ride. I will show an example deployment of Kafka on Kubernetes and step through the system to explain the common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

In less than 20 years Bol.com grew to over 1500 employees and with over 100 scrum teams. On the technology side bol.com started out with a monolithic architecture that could handle it all. Due to the explosive growth of bol.com, the system quickly faced its limitations. On top of this, given the pace and competition in the e-commerce market requires bol.com to keep innovating rapidly to stay in business.\n\nAll these factors imply that bol.com must keep innovating but systems built today will probably have difficulties satisfying the market requirements in less than 5 years. Yet, these systems are still essential to establish bol.com as the leading retailer platform in the Benelux. In other words, even that we know that systems are going to be obsolete soon they still need to be built. This is what we call the Accelerated Legacy Challenge.\n\nIn this talk we will present how bol.com faces the Accelerated Legacy Challenge. We will focus the talk on the backend systems. \nFirst, we will discuss how we handle deprecations. Due to timing and cost, bol.com cannot “simply replace” those systems. \nSecondly, we will illustrate the dynamic requirements new systems will have to handle. Our volumes and growth are so high that often we introduce different technologies in a system to handle differences of speed and volume at each stage of processing. \nFinally, we conclude by providing our view on best practices to define an architecture that can handle this. Here we will illustrate how the cloud helps us to move from monoliths to a managed-service-architecture. \n","talkTitle":"Bol.com and the Accelerated Legacy Challenge","talkId":41655},{"id":29755,"fromDate":"2019-11-06T12:05:00Z","toDate":"2019-11-06T12:20:00Z","overflow":false,"reserved":false,"remark":null,"roomId":1208,"roomName":"Room 10","sessionTypeId":1257,"sessionTypeName":"Quickie","sessionTypeDuration":15,"sessionTypeBreak":false,"audienceLevel":"BEGINNER","langName":null,"timezone":"Europe/Brussels","trackId":"1151","trackName":"Methodology & Culture","trackImageURL":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/voxxeddays/webapp/images/710ace39-49e0-4935-9734-7cda98204fa4.png","speakers":[{"id":50842,"firstName":"Sjoerd","lastName":"Houben","company":"AgileLabs"}],"tags":[{"name":"methodology"},{"name":"Agile"},{"name":"culture"}],"talkDescription":"So mob programming is kind of weird - or that's how it can look at first.

Requirements for concurrent applications under heavy load are the reason for this growth in popularity. Traditional programming technique based on blocking IO operations do not scale because OS kernel threads, the software unit of concurrency, are too heavyweight to directly represent fine-grained domain units of concurrency, such as the user session or the transaction. \n\nThese techniques come at a great cost and do not integrate at all smoothly with the core ideas of imperative programming languages -- they require built-in constructs to be reimplemented in DSLs, lose important context, and make interoperation with existing code very difficult. Therefore, instead of abandoning the abstraction most natural for imperative code, the thread and synchronous operations, we have decided to provide a lightweight implementation of threads, in the runtime rather than the OS, in the JDK, as part of Project Loom. \n\nThis talk will present the work done in Project Loom, focusing on fibers and structured concurrency, explain why we believe this is the correct approach for the JDK, and discuss some of the peculiar challenges of implementing lightweight threads in the JVM.
