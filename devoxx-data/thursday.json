It's been mentioned as such in various \"Ask the Experts\" panels over the past few years. Joshua Bloch's book \"Effective Java\" describes many dangers of serialization, and it devotes an entire chapter to the topic. But isn't this merely a recent group of Java platform designers complaining about a bad design produced by an earlier group of Java platform designers?\n\nIn fact, Java serialization was well designed for its intended purposes. In the 1990s, big topics of the day included transparent persistence of objects and distributed objects. Transparent persistence is the ability to save and restore objects without requiring explicit code in those objects. Distributed objects involves the transfer of objects and interactions among objects over a network, as in Java RMI. In the context of the late 1990s, Java Serialization supported both of these goals quite well.\n\nThe problem is that, while most of the industry has moved on from these goals, Java Serialization is still embedded deeply and pervasively into the platform. With most obsolescent features, libraries and applications can simply ignore them, and doing so poses no issues. Java Serialization is different. Code that on its face appears correct and secure might have bugs or security holes caused by the mere presence of serialization in the platform, even if that code doesn't use serialization explicitly. In many cases, it is simply not possible for high assurance code to ignore the possibility of serialization. Historically, and continuing to this day, serialization is the direct cause of many bugs and security holes in Java appplications, libraries, and in the JDK itself. Serialization thus imposes costs across the platform that cannot be ignored.\n\nThis talk is neither a tutorial on serialization, nor is it merely a rant about how bad Java Serialization is. (We can't guarantee there won't be ranting, however.) It is instead a thorough analysis of a few of the fundamental aspects of the design of Java Serialization that, in retrospect, can be considered flaws. We will then provide examples of bugs in the JDK that resulted directly from these design decisions. Informed by this analysis, we will then proceed to describe potential new mechanisms we are exploring that may eventually replace the current Java Serialization mechanism. The direction of the new mechanism is to ensure that it is well integrated with the language model, and where necessary, that the language model is enhanced to accommodate serialization. Another strong direction is to make the mechanisms explicit in the source code. This will make it possible to verify and reason about the correctness and security of a program by examining it, without having to consider \"extra-lingual\" mechanisms or \"magical\" behavior exhibited by the current Java Serialization mechanism.","talkTitle":"Why We Hate Java Serialization And What We're Doing About It","talkId":51403},{"id":26861,"fromDate":"2019-11-07T08:30:00Z","toDate":"2019-11-07T09:20:00Z","overflow":false,"reserved":true,"remark":"RedHat","roomId":1208,"roomName":"Room 10","sessionTypeId":1251,"sessionTypeName":"Conference","sessionTypeDuration":50,"sessionTypeBreak":false,"audienceLevel":null,"langName":null,"timezone":"Europe/Brussels","trackId":null,"trackName":null,"trackImageURL":null,"speakers":null,"tags":null,"talkDescription":null,"talkTitle":null,"talkId":null},{"id":26870,"fromDate":"2019-11-07T09:20:00Z","toDate":"2019-11-07T09:40:00Z","overflow":false,"reserved":false,"remark":null,"roomId":1203,"roomName":"Exhibition Hall","sessionTypeId":26901,"sessionTypeName":"Break","sessionTypeDuration":20,"sessionTypeBreak":true,"audienceLevel":null,"langName":null,"timezone":"Europe/Brussels","trackId":null,"trackName":null,"trackImageURL":null,"speakers":null,"tags":null,"talkDescription":null,"talkTitle":null,"talkId":null},{"id":27514,"fromDate":"2019-11-07T09:40:00Z","toDate":"2019-11-07T10:30:00Z","overflow":false,"reserved":false,"remark":null,"roomId":1204,"roomName":"Room 3","sessionTypeId":1251,"sessionTypeName":"Conference","sessionTypeDuration":50,"sessionTypeBreak":false,"audienceLevel":"BEGINNER","langName":null,"timezone":"Europe/Brussels","trackId":"1158","trackName":"Mind the Geek","trackImageURL":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/voxxeddays/webapp/images/0bac192f-aa3c-4288-bad0-4dd4abdbbdc1.png","speakers":[{"id":52024,"firstName":"David","lastName":"Delabassée","company":"Oracle"}],"tags":[{"name":"Machine learning"},{"name":"Computer Vision"},{"name":"Panama"}],"talkDescription":"The goal of this session is to leverage computer vision, machine learning and Java to modernize the casual 'Rock, Paper, Scissor' game.

Better get familiar with JavaScript! JavaScript has long been the king of front-end. While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to.

But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\n\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with both Rust and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language.

There are legitimate reasons for the meteoric rise of Modern Native Languages - Go, Swift and Rust - over the last few years. Program safety and memory management are baked into the compiled code (Go has a Garbage Collector). Powerful type checkers have helped make these languages very expressive, easily embracing the functional programming paradigm. Being native, they naturally tend to be well performant and have a low memory overhead. \n\nWe can say the modern native languages have struck a good balance between expressive power, speed and safety - aspects which have exhibited mutual trade-offs in the past.

Building a Serverless solution is completely different from conventional application development, which raises a ton of questions about whether this is a suitable replacement for the monolith.

When they arrive, which is probably sooner than you think, all of our classical encryption algorithms are dead.\n\nShor's algorithm was formulated by Peter Shor in 1994. By using some fairly simple number theory, a bit of computationally complex (for a classical computer) modular exponentiation and some quantum magic, Shor's algorithm can efficiently factorise numbers. The quantum magic is weird, very weird. By using the Quantum Fourier Transform a quantum computer can exploit the interference pattern generated in parallel universes to discover the periodicity of modular exponentiation without actually calculating successive powers.\n\nSo what can we do when RSA dies and what should we do now? BB84 is provably secure and also relies on quantum mechanics, specifically the polarisation of light photons. I will demonstrate BB84 as well as some classical algorithms that we can be using now that are quantum safe.\n\nThe talk includes an explanation of how Shor works, a demonstration of an implementation of Shor using Q#, an explanation of BB84 and classical quantum safe algorithms and a lot of fun in the process.","talkTitle":"RSA is Dead.

Still, I believe that:\n1) your mistakes teach you more than your successes;\n2) we can learn from each other.\n\nSo in this BOF, I'll willingly tell my mistakes and how they shaped me.

These BOFs have always been the most succesful ones compared to other conferences. Based on last years discussion we've improved Maven by being able to show where every element in the effective pom is coming from. With the growth of the projects it can be quite hard to understand how Maven calculates the effective pom, hence this improvement should give more control.","talkTitle":"Apache Maven BOF","talkId":50255}]
