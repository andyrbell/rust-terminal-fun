    "description": "Accessing foreign (e.g. off-heap) memory from a Java application can be useful for a number of reasons, from avoiding the costs associated with garbage collection, to sharing memory across multiple processes and/or with native code. Yet, to date, the Java SE API provides no official tools for accessing foreign memory, forcing developers to cope with less than ideal solutions. One such solution, perhaps the most widely used, is the ByteBuffer API, which allows the creation of so called \"direct\" byte buffers --- thus allowing users to manipulate off-heap memory directly from Java. Another, less common, avenue by which developer can access foreign memory from Java code is through the Unsafe API, which exposes several low-level functionalities to manipulate both off-heap and on-heap memory directly, and in a very efficient fashion, thanks to its clever use of JVM intrinsics. Unfortunately, existing approaches for accessing foreign memory are far from being ideal: on the one hand, the ByteBuffer API, which has been designed after I/O use cases, suffers from several limitations --- lack of addressing space, non-deterministic deallocation to name a few --- when used as a general purpose foreign memory API; on the other hand, using the Unsafe API -- as the name implies -- is a risky business, which can result in hard JVM crashes if the API is not used correctly. In other words, when it comes to accessing foreign memory, no optimal solution exists - and Java developers are faced with a dilemma: should they use the safe, trodded but twisted (and possibly less efficient) ByteBuffer path or should they abandon all safety guarantees and embrace the (unsupported) Unsafe API? In this talk we paint the path to the future: a safe, supported and efficient foreign memory access API for Java. By providing a more targeted solution to the problem of accessing foreign memory, not only developers will be freed by the limitations of the existing APIs - but they will also enjoy improved performances, as the new API will be designed from the ground-up with JIT optimizations in mind - and all without sacrificing memory access safety.

    "description": "Bol.com started in a portacabin with a handful of employees and essentially one IT team. In less than 20 years Bol.com grew to over 1500 employees and with over 100 scrum teams. On the technology side bol.com started out with a monolithic architecture that could handle it all. Due to the explosive growth of bol.com, the system quickly faced its limitations. On top of this, given the pace and competition in the e-commerce market requires bol.com to keep innovating rapidly to stay in business.\n\nAll these factors imply that bol.com must keep innovating but systems built today will probably have difficulties satisfying the market requirements in less than 5 years. Yet, these systems are still essential to establish bol.com as the leading retailer platform in the Benelux. In other words, even that we know that systems are going to be obsolete soon they still need to be built. This is what we call the Accelerated Legacy Challenge.\n\nIn this talk we will present how bol.com faces the Accelerated Legacy Challenge. We will focus the talk on the backend systems. \nFirst, we will discuss how we handle deprecations. Due to timing and cost, bol.com cannot “simply replace” those systems. \nSecondly, we will illustrate the dynamic requirements new systems will have to handle. Our volumes and growth are so high that often we introduce different technologies in a system to handle differences of speed and volume at each stage of processing. \nFinally, we conclude by providing our view on best practices to define an architecture that can handle this. Here we will illustrate how the cloud helps us to move from monoliths to a managed-service-architecture. \n",

Instead, it's a deep exploration of some of the corners of the Collections Framework that will reveal some little-known features.

There's a lot more to collections than that, though. The Collections Framework has a rich set of APIs with surprising depth. This session isn't a typical survey of the Collections interfaces and implementation classes. Instead, it's a deep exploration of some of the corners of the Collections Framework that will reveal some little-known features. These features can be useful and powerful, but their behavior can also be startling, leading to unexpected bugs for the unwary. Attend this session for a unique and educational look at the Collections Framework.",

For the Flemish Government, this means that humans still need to read doctor's handwritings and enter the text in databases through custom-made data-entry form applications. This is a time-consuming process, especially for medical data, which needs to be treated with great accuracy. Also, a fraction of about 10% of handwritings cannot be read with sufficient accuracy by a human, and requires double-checking.\n\nWe developed a data-processing pipeline for one such use case with the goal of supporting the humans by reading the handwritings and predicting what is written. Together with the predicted text, we calculate confidences for the predictions and we show that we can define confidence levels above which the machine predictions perform better than a human. We also show that the machine can suggest predictions for illegible handwritings, which allows the human to decreases the number of illegible handwritings by about 30%.\n\nIn this presentation, we will present the end-to-end pipeline, from data mining and anonymisation, through data cleaning with numerous image-processing steps, to building and applying the deep-learning model, augmented with some natural language processing.

This innovative way of developing and deploying Java applications has been pushed to the next level by Quarkus that provides a full-stack development experience seamlessly integrating many widely used Java libraries and thus opens the door for next generation of middleware. Business automation is an important players in this context and Kogito, a new Java toolkit based on Drools and jBPM, is made to bring rules and processes to the Quarkus world.\n\nAfter a quick introduction to Kogito we'll show in a live conding session how it can be used to build cloud ready event-driven business applications. Starting from scratch we'll create micorservices implementing the business logic of a complex domain with rules and modelling its workflows through business processes. We will demonstrate how Quarkus hot reload capabilities can be used to design this business logic in an iterative way, how to integrate these services with Kafka to process business events, how to monitor them with Prometheus and Grafana and finally how to deploy everything into the cloud.",

This innovative way of developing and deploying Java applications has been pushed to the next level by Quarkus that provides a full-stack development experience seamlessly integrating many widely used Java libraries and thus opens the door for next generation of middleware. Business automation is an important players in this context and Kogito, a new Java toolkit based on Drools and jBPM, is made to bring rules and processes to the Quarkus world.\n\nAfter a quick introduction to Kogito we'll show in a live conding session how it can be used to build cloud ready event-driven business applications. Starting from scratch we'll create micorservices implementing the business logic of a complex domain with rules and modelling its workflows through business processes. We will demonstrate how Quarkus hot reload capabilities can be used to design this business logic in an iterative way, how to integrate these services with Kafka to process business events, how to monitor them with Prometheus and Grafana and finally how to deploy everything into the cloud.",

    "description": "Are you in a mood for a brainstorm? Join this critical review of the major decisions taken in a typical enterprise application architecture and learn to balance pragmatism with your design goals. Find out how to do just-in-time design to keep as many use-cases as simple as possible. The core purpose of this presentation is to learn to strike a **balance between pragmatism and maintainability** in your design. Without continuous refactoring, a simple design will inevitably degenerate into a Big Ball of Mud, under the assault of the new features and bugfixes. On the other hand, the very highly-factored code can burden the take-off of the development and end up freezing the mindset in some rigid upfront design. The end goal of this talk is to challenge you to rethink critically the architecture of your systems and seek ways to simplify it to match your actual needs, with a pragmatic mindset. \"Architecture is the art of postponing decisions\", said Uncle Bob. This talk takes this idea further and explains an optimal mindset about designing enterprise applications: Evolving (Continuously Refactoring) a Pragmatic (Simple), Clean (aka Onion) Architecture, aiming to provide Developer Safety™️ and Comfort™️. It’s the philosophy that Victor distilled over the past 5 years, designing and implementing 9 applications as IBM Lead Architect, and delivering training and advises to many other companies. You’ll learn how to break data into pieces (Fit Entities, Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects), how to keep the logic simple (Facades, Domain Services, logic extraction patterns, Mappers, AOP), layering to enforce boundaries (keeping DTOs out of your logic, Dependency Inversion Principle), and many more, all in a dynamic, interactive and extremely entertaining session.",

The end goal of this talk is to challenge you to rethink critically the architecture of your systems and seek ways to simplify it to match your actual needs, with a pragmatic mindset. \"Architecture is the art of postponing decisions\", said Uncle Bob. This talk takes this idea further and explains an optimal mindset about designing enterprise applications: Evolving (Continuously Refactoring) a Pragmatic (Simple), Clean (aka Onion) Architecture, aiming to provide Developer Safety™️ and Comfort™️. It’s the philosophy that Victor distilled over the past 5 years, designing and implementing 9 applications as IBM Lead Architect, and delivering training and advises to many other companies. You’ll learn how to break data into pieces (Fit Entities, Value Objects, Data Transfer Objects), how to keep the logic simple (Facades, Domain Services, logic extraction patterns, Mappers, AOP), layering to enforce boundaries (keeping DTOs out of your logic, Dependency Inversion Principle), and many more, all in a dynamic, interactive and extremely entertaining session.",

Even before the photographer can say ‘SMILE’, the Duke is already gone. We would like to help you to change this. \nWithin this HOL you will be using DL4J (Deep Learning 4 Java) to train a neural network into recognising the Duke. By using Transfer Learning, we will make sure that you can train your network within minutes. You will get a first experience in building neural networks, how you can train them and how you can improve your network. \nTo help you test your setup, all participants will be given a custom made a stuffed Duke figure. With the help of this figure you can make sure that you will be able to get a picture of the Duke the next time he flashes by. Off course you can take the Duke home to keep improving your software.\nAfter this HOL you will have learned how to use Java in combination with DL4J to build and train a deep learning network. You will be able to create your own trainings data and retrain the network to recognize anything you want. \nFor this HOL you do not need any experience with Deep Learning. Basic programming knowledge should suffice. \n",

Even before the photographer can say ‘SMILE’, the Duke is already gone. We would like to help you to change this. \nWithin this HOL you will be using DL4J (Deep Learning 4 Java) to train a neural network into recognising the Duke. By using Transfer Learning, we will make sure that you can train your network within minutes. You will get a first experience in building neural networks, how you can train them and how you can improve your network. \nTo help you test your setup, all participants will be given a custom made a stuffed Duke figure. With the help of this figure you can make sure that you will be able to get a picture of the Duke the next time he flashes by. Off course you can take the Duke home to keep improving your software.\nAfter this HOL you will have learned how to use Java in combination with DL4J to build and train a deep learning network. You will be able to create your own trainings data and retrain the network to recognize anything you want. \nFor this HOL you do not need any experience with Deep Learning. Basic programming knowledge should suffice. \n",

The theoretical background of each of these transformations is going to be discussed with a focus  on its limitations and the possible trade offs that could be made. Various techniques and heuristics for improving the human readability of the decompiled code are going to be presented.  The overall practical limitations and usefulness of decompilation are then going to be discussed in the light of the knowledge presented so far. A short overview of the obfuscation techniques and their limitations and usefulness is going to conclude the talk.",

    "description": "The JVM is a truly remarkable piece of software, but it is still just a computer program, not magic! In this talk, I will explain how we might start to implement a JVM from scratch, using the Rust programming language. Fundamental concepts such as the bytecode interpreter, classfile parsing and memory management will be explained using an open-source implementation as reference. We will build up a working interpreter capable of executing simple methods (initially represented as byte arrays). From there, we add features and build towards a more complete implementation that can actually execute simple Java classes.\n\nThe talk is largely live coding in the IDE, where I will work with an implementation of the JVM written in Rust. The implementation is designed to be easy to understand even for developers who are new to language implementation.

    "description": "The API Gateway pattern is a well-known solution to the problem of clients communicating with a microservices-based application. It relieves browsers or mobile devices from sending several requests to display a single web page or screen.\n\nIn practice, the pattern is often implemented as an HTTP/JSON service. Therefore it is difficult for the web, mobile and backend developers to settle on a payload format that is both flexible and concise to suit all the different kinds of frontends.\n\nGraphQL is a query and schema definition language for your backend services. It can be used over different transports (e. g. HTTP, Websocket) and provides frontend developers with the ability to request exactly the information they need, making it a great solution to implement the API Gateway pattern.\n\nThis workshop starts with a brief introduction to GraphQL. Then you will build a gateway for a music store microservices-based application. You will learn how to fetch data from HTTP services or a Postgres database and protect users with authentication. We will focus on the use case instead of the GraphQL technology itself (there are plenty of resources for that on the web).\n\nSoftware requirements:\n\n- JDK8 or JDK11\n- Recent version of Maven\n- Recent version of Postgres database (or Docker)\n- Java IDE",

A lot of this is generated in the form of a never ending stream of events, with publishers creating the events and subscribers consuming them in many different ways. This is where Apache Kafka comes in, Kafka isn't just a messaging system - it's an event streaming platform. This session will introduce Kafka and explain concepts such as topic partitioning, consumer groups and exactly-once semantics. This session will give you the knowledge you need to start your journey with the event streaming platform that everyone is talking about.",

A lot of this is generated in the form of a never ending stream of events, with publishers creating the events and subscribers consuming them in many different ways. This is where Apache Kafka comes in, Kafka isn't just a messaging system - it's an event streaming platform. This session will introduce Kafka and explain concepts such as topic partitioning, consumer groups and exactly-once semantics. This session will give you the knowledge you need to start your journey with the event streaming platform that everyone is talking about.",

But we’ve noticed that development teams often struggle when they use vanilla Kubernetes for application deployments. By all means, use Kubernetes to push containers all day long. But if you want to push application code — or a function — Kubernetes on its own isn’t enough.\n\nKnative is an open source software layer that helps cloud service providers and enterprise platform operators deliver a serverless experience to developers on any cloud. It’s a way to abstract the operational overhead of deploying and managing workloads that run on K8s and provides a consistent approach so that developers can focus on writing cool code. It also gives build primitives that allows for creating pipelines for building and deploying on Kubernetes from Kubernetes.\n\nIn this talk we will learn what Knative is, why it was created and how you can get started.",

But we’ve noticed that development teams often struggle when they use vanilla Kubernetes for application deployments. By all means, use Kubernetes to push containers all day long. But if you want to push application code — or a function — Kubernetes on its own isn’t enough.\n\nKnative is an open source software layer that helps cloud service providers and enterprise platform operators deliver a serverless experience to developers on any cloud. It’s a way to abstract the operational overhead of deploying and managing workloads that run on K8s and provides a consistent approach so that developers can focus on writing cool code. It also gives build primitives that allows for creating pipelines for building and deploying on Kubernetes from Kubernetes.\n\nIn this talk we will learn what Knative is, why it was created and how you can get started.",

In this session, we will strip them to bare math, so next time you use a machine learning library, you'll have a deeper understanding of what lies underneath.\n\nDuring this session, we will first provide a short history of machine learning and an overview of two basic teaching techniques: supervised and unsupervised learning.\n\nWe will start by defining what machine learning is and equip you with an intuition of how it works. We will then explain gradient descent algorithm with the use of simple linear regression to give you an even deeper understanding of this learning method. Then we will project it to supervised neural networks training.\n\nWithin unsupervised learning, you will become familiar with Hebb’s learning and learning with concurrency (winner takes all and winner takes most algorithms). We will use Octave for examples in this session; however, you can use your favorite technology to implement presented ideas.\n\nOur aim is to show the mathematical basics of neural networks for those who want to start using machine learning in their day-to-day work or use it already but find it difficult to understand the underlying processes. After viewing our presentation, you should find it easier to select parameters for your networks and feel more confident in your selection of network type, as well as be encouraged to dive into more complex and powerful deep learning methods.",

We will use Octave for examples in this session; however, you can use your favorite technology to implement presented ideas.\n\nOur aim is to show the mathematical basics of neural networks for those who want to start using machine learning in their day-to-day work or use it already but find it difficult to understand the underlying processes. After viewing our presentation, you should find it easier to select parameters for your networks and feel more confident in your selection of network type, as well as be encouraged to dive into more complex and powerful deep learning methods.",

This new platform UI is broken down into separate micro applications, views, and other extension points. This extensible way of building a platform allows us to reduce the toil for our development teams to work on new features and bring value to our customers much faster. This new architecture was not only built for internal development but also allows third-party (customers) developers to extend our platform for their own special use cases.\n\nBased on our real-world experience going through this transition, we will take a look at the benefits that come with such an architecture, such as ease of deployments, increased team autonomy, localized complexity, and more. There were also many challenges along the way and we will reflect on how we tackled some of the hardest problems we faced regarding performance, resiliency, UI consistency, scalability, and even organizational changes.",

This new platform UI is broken down into separate micro applications, views, and other extension points. This extensible way of building a platform allows us to reduce the toil for our development teams to work on new features and bring value to our customers much faster. This new architecture was not only built for internal development but also allows third-party (customers) developers to extend our platform for their own special use cases.\n\nBased on our real-world experience going through this transition, we will take a look at the benefits that come with such an architecture, such as ease of deployments, increased team autonomy, localized complexity, and more. There were also many challenges along the way and we will reflect on how we tackled some of the hardest problems we faced regarding performance, resiliency, UI consistency, scalability, and even organizational changes.",

    "title": "Modern Native Languages - Are they viable alternatives to JVM languages?",
    "description": "The turn of the 21st century saw massive adoption of a new category of programming languages, pioneered by Java, running inside the Java Virtual Machine. The virtual machine promised platform independence, memory management and program safety, something which the then native languages like C/C++ lacked, at the cost of some performance. \n\nOver the last decade, advances in compilation technology and  memory management techniques have led to a great comeback of native languages. There are legitimate reasons for the meteoric rise of Modern Native Languages - Go, Swift and Rust - over the last few years. Program safety and memory management are baked into the compiled code (Go has a Garbage Collector). Powerful type checkers have helped make these languages very expressive, easily embracing the functional programming paradigm. Being native, they naturally tend to be well performant and have a low memory overhead. \n\nWe can say the modern native languages have struck a good balance between expressive power, speed and safety - aspects which have exhibited mutual trade-offs in the past. But are they really viable alternatives to languages to the JVM languages? This quickie will help the audience understand their positives and negatives.",

        "talkDescription": "The turn of the 21st century saw massive adoption of a new category of programming languages, pioneered by Java, running inside the Java Virtual Machine. The virtual machine promised platform independence, memory management and program safety, something which the then native languages like C/C++ lacked, at the cost of some performance. \n\nOver the last decade, advances in compilation technology and  memory management techniques have led to a great comeback of native languages. There are legitimate reasons for the meteoric rise of Modern Native Languages - Go, Swift and Rust - over the last few years. Program safety and memory management are baked into the compiled code (Go has a Garbage Collector). Powerful type checkers have helped make these languages very expressive, easily embracing the functional programming paradigm. Being native, they naturally tend to be well performant and have a low memory overhead. \n\nWe can say the modern native languages have struck a good balance between expressive power, speed and safety - aspects which have exhibited mutual trade-offs in the past. But are they really viable alternatives to languages to the JVM languages? This quickie will help the audience understand their positives and negatives.",

The first prototype was put together in less than a week, and was able to play a few songs a lot better than I ever will. There is a lot of stuff that you need to take in consideration, from materials used to keeping the rhythm of the music, reading music, controlling hardware etc.\n\nIn this talk I will go through the lessons that I’ve learned while building the apparatus both with hard and software, but will mainly go into the Java software. That was build with Dropwizard to control the Angular frond-end. Of course Pi4J was used to control the hardware. Note: there is only 1 Raspberry PI controlling everything, from the UI to the hardware!\n\nMaybe you will be inspired to automate your own instrument… of course there will be a live demo at the end! And the audience can pick a song*.",

The first prototype was put together in less than a week, and was able to play a few songs a lot better than I ever will. There is a lot of stuff that you need to take in consideration, from materials used to keeping the rhythm of the music, reading music, controlling hardware etc.\n\nIn this talk I will go through the lessons that I’ve learned while building the apparatus both with hard and software, but will mainly go into the Java software. That was build with Dropwizard to control the Angular frond-end. Of course Pi4J was used to control the hardware. Note: there is only 1 Raspberry PI controlling everything, from the UI to the hardware!\n\nMaybe you will be inspired to automate your own instrument… of course there will be a live demo at the end! And the audience can pick a song*.",

Those attacks are not theoretical anymore.\n\nThis talk will highlight potential attack vectors and explain how we can mitigate them. The build tool is by definition insecure because it's a free execution environment. However, there are ways we can reduce the risks, or even significantly reduce them. Some topics we will cover:\n\n- making sure the dependencies you use are the ones you expect\n- using checksums and signatures\n- rejecting vulnerable dependencies\n- build reproducibility\n- disposable build environments and mitigating performance issues related to them\n- testing external contributions\n\nWe will mostly illustrate those with Gradle but most of the recommendations are also valid with Apache Maven.",

Sometimes without noticing (in the IDE), sometimes explicitly from the CLI (gradle test, mvn clean test), sometimes from CI. \nHowever, barely anyone recognizes the security risks of building software. Those attacks are not theoretical anymore.\n\nThis talk will highlight potential attack vectors and explain how we can mitigate them. The build tool is by definition insecure because it's a free execution environment. However, there are ways we can reduce the risks, or even significantly reduce them. Some topics we will cover:\n\n- making sure the dependencies you use are the ones you expect\n- using checksums and signatures\n- rejecting vulnerable dependencies\n- build reproducibility\n- disposable build environments and mitigating performance issues related to them\n- testing external contributions\n\nWe will mostly illustrate those with Gradle but most of the recommendations are also valid with Apache Maven.",

    "description": "Whether you are counting cars on a road or people stranded on rooftops in a natural disaster, there are plenty of use cases for object detection. Often times, pre-trained object detection models do not suit our needs and we need to create our own custom models.\n\nHow can we utilize machine learning to train our own custom model without substantive computing power and time?\nAnswer: Watson Machine Learning.\n\nHow can we leverage our custom trained model to detect object’s, in real-time, with complete user privacy, all in the browser?\nAnswer: TensorFlow.js.\n\nIn this workshop, you will create a web app that does just that. You will learn how to create an IBM Cloud Object Storage instance to store your labeled data. Once your data is ready, you will learn how to spin up a Watson Machine Learning instance to train your own custom model on top-of-the-line GPUs. After your model has completed training, you can simply plug the TensorFlow.js model into your react application.\n\nAt the end of this workshop, you should understand how to:\n- Label data that can be used for object detection\n- Use your custom data to train a model using Watson Machine Learning\n- Detect objects with TensorFlow.js in the browser",

Can CV complements ML?\nAnd don’t worry, even though computer vision and machine learning are sometimes very academic topics, this session will be fun and very hands-on....literally!",

It starts with a (gentle) introduction to computer vision. Those newly learned skills will then be used to implement the necessary hand gesture recognition with OpenCV. The presentation concludes by spicing up the game to contrast and compare computer vision with machine learning. What are the benefits (and limitations) of CV vs. ML? Can CV complements ML?\nAnd don’t worry, even though computer vision and machine learning are sometimes very academic topics, this session will be fun and very hands-on....literally!",

    "description": "Quantum computers are coming. When they arrive, which is probably sooner than you think, all of our classical encryption algorithms are dead.\n\nShor's algorithm was formulated by Peter Shor in 1994. By using some fairly simple number theory, a bit of computationally complex (for a classical computer) modular exponentiation and some quantum magic, Shor's algorithm can efficiently factorise numbers. The quantum magic is weird, very weird. By using the Quantum Fourier Transform a quantum computer can exploit the interference pattern generated in parallel universes to discover the periodicity of modular exponentiation without actually calculating successive powers.\n\nSo what can we do when RSA dies and what should we do now? BB84 is provably secure and also relies on quantum mechanics, specifically the polarisation of light photons. I will demonstrate BB84 as well as some classical algorithms that we can be using now that are quantum safe.\n\nThe talk includes an explanation of how Shor works, a demonstration of an implementation of Shor using Q#, an explanation of BB84 and classical quantum safe algorithms and a lot of fun in the process.",

This talk will provide context for this issue, explore real-world examples and discuss ideas for potential solutions.\n\nTogether let's discover:\n- How our datasets and algorithms share societies historical social biases.\n- Why this could cause results to be inaccurate and further exaggerate existing discrimination.\n- How we can assess the impact and change this from a risk into a powerful solution.",

    "description": "One of the more important aspects of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is it’s managed memory subsystem. It’s an amazing piece of technology in that it allows developers to allocate a seemingly infinite amount of memory. The reality is that under the covers, the JVM is working on reclaiming all memory that is no longer in use. If the JVM is unable to recover memory, our application will fail with a dreaded OutOfMemoryError.\n\nThis session will cover several common scenarios that can cause the JVM to fail with an OutOfMemoryError. We’ll explore tooling and methods that can be used to diagnose the cause of an OutOfMemoryError. Finally, we’ll go toe to toe with apps suffer from an OutOfMemoryError for different reasons. Topics that will be covered include; 1. Overview of Java heap 2. Allocations in Java heap 3. GC basics with Mark and Sweep 4. Normal life cycle of a Java object 5. Common causes of OutOfMemoryError 6. Anatomy of a memory leak 7. Tools for detecting memory leaks",

We prefer to have that one colleague perform “something with certificates”, because he/she knows how that works. But what if “that one colleague” is enjoying vacation and something goes wrong with the certificates?\n\nIn this session we’ll take a close look at secure communication at the transport level. Starting with what exactly SSL and TLS is, we’ll dive into public/private keys, and signing. We’ll also learn what all this has to do with an unfortunate Dutch notary. Of course, there’ll be plenty of practical tips & trics, as well as demo’s.\n\nAttend this session to become “that one colleague”!",

Big Data is in fact like raw ore; you need to process it the right way to reveal its real treasure. Data visualizations allow us to gain knowledge out of pure texts and numbers, to tell the stories that lie behind the data. In this interactive workshop, we are talking about the thought process, the techniques, the tools and technologies on how your data can show its deeper meaning all the way from cancer diagnosis and microelectronics to housing prices and even your own zodiac sign!\n\nLearning Outcomes\nExperience at first hand the thought process behind engaging data visualisations used in the industry and the academia\nLearn how to think visually\nExperiment with known javascript-based data-visualisation libraries, such as D3.js, highcharts.js, and Vega\nTell the story your data has to reveal in a fun and creative way",

    "title": "Why We Hate Java Serialization And What We're Doing About It",
    "description": "Java Serialization is well known to be one of the worst features of Java. It's been mentioned as such in various \"Ask the Experts\" panels over the past few years. Joshua Bloch's book \"Effective Java\" describes many dangers of serialization, and it devotes an entire chapter to the topic. But isn't this merely a recent group of Java platform designers complaining about a bad design produced by an earlier group of Java platform designers?\n\nIn fact, Java serialization was well designed for its intended purposes. In the 1990s, big topics of the day included transparent persistence of objects and distributed objects. Transparent persistence is the ability to save and restore objects without requiring explicit code in those objects. Distributed objects involves the transfer of objects and interactions among objects over a network, as in Java RMI. In the context of the late 1990s, Java Serialization supported both of these goals quite well.\n\nThe problem is that, while most of the industry has moved on from these goals, Java Serialization is still embedded deeply and pervasively into the platform. With most obsolescent features, libraries and applications can simply ignore them, and doing so poses no issues. Java Serialization is different. Code that on its face appears correct and secure might have bugs or security holes caused by the mere presence of serialization in the platform, even if that code doesn't use serialization explicitly. In many cases, it is simply not possible for high assurance code to ignore the possibility of serialization. Historically, and continuing to this day, serialization is the direct cause of many bugs and security holes in Java appplications, libraries, and in the JDK itself. Serialization thus imposes costs across the platform that cannot be ignored.\n\nThis talk is neither a tutorial on serialization, nor is it merely a rant about how bad Java Serialization is. (We can't guarantee there won't be ranting, however.) It is instead a thorough analysis of a few of the fundamental aspects of the design of Java Serialization that, in retrospect, can be considered flaws. We will then provide examples of bugs in the JDK that resulted directly from these design decisions. Informed by this analysis, we will then proceed to describe potential new mechanisms we are exploring that may eventually replace the current Java Serialization mechanism. The direction of the new mechanism is to ensure that it is well integrated with the language model, and where necessary, that the language model is enhanced to accommodate serialization. Another strong direction is to make the mechanisms explicit in the source code. This will make it possible to verify and reason about the correctness and security of a program by examining it, without having to consider \"extra-lingual\" mechanisms or \"magical\" behavior exhibited by the current Java Serialization mechanism.",

There are many great pragmatic results when pairing is delivered inside a flexible corporate and culturally sensitive environment. On the other hand, pairing is not everyone’s cup of tea, I will provide pointers to defend against social anti-patterns and accidental bad practice. Of course, pair-development is closely associated with Agile software development lifecycle and extreme programming (XP), but don’t let that fact put you off from attending. Finally, pair-development is exciting way create high quality software for modern organisations. Whether you partially do this technology or apply it 100% of the time, it is a necessary step in a professional career. \n\nIf you are a developer, technical-lead or designer and you never ever worked in a close proximity situation with a work mate then this might be the lunchtime talk for you.\n",

In this quicktime talk, I divulge my impressions about the impact of pair-programming at clients where I have seen genuine benefits. There are many great pragmatic results when pairing is delivered inside a flexible corporate and culturally sensitive environment. On the other hand, pairing is not everyone’s cup of tea, I will provide pointers to defend against social anti-patterns and accidental bad practice. Of course, pair-development is closely associated with Agile software development lifecycle and extreme programming (XP), but don’t let that fact put you off from attending. Finally, pair-development is exciting way create high quality software for modern organisations. Whether you partially do this technology or apply it 100% of the time, it is a necessary step in a professional career. \n\nIf you are a developer, technical-lead or designer and you never ever worked in a close proximity situation with a work mate then this might be the lunchtime talk for you.\n",

Brought over from popular classical object-oriented languages, they've not been argued an unnecessary feature for JavaScript, but their usage can become actually harmful very easily. In this talk we'll take a look at the potential issues and pitfalls of using classes, like the need for context binding of methods, and suggest alternative patterns that are conceptually simpler, easier to work with, safer to use, more idiomatic, require less code and are actually more powerful.",
